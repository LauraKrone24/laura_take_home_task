### Answer the question based on the information in the context.\nQuestion: What are the causes of climate change\nContext:
The main driver of climate change is the greenhouse effect. Some gases present in the Earth's atmosphere act like the glass of a greenhouse: they let in the sun's heat but prevent it from radiating back into space, leading to global warming.

Many of these greenhouse gases are natural components of the Earth's atmosphere; however, as a result of human activity, the concentration of some gases has risen sharply. This applies in particular to

Carbon dioxide (CO2)
methane
Nitrous oxide
Fluorinated gases
CO2 produced by human activity is the biggest contributor to global warming. By 2020, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere had risen to 48% above pre-industrial levels (before 1750).

Other greenhouse gases are emitted in smaller quantities by human activities. Methane is a stronger greenhouse gas than CO2, but has a shorter lifetime in the atmosphere. Nitrous oxide, like CO2, is a long-lived greenhouse gas that accumulates in the atmosphere over decades and centuries. Non-greenhouse gases, including aerosols such as soot, have different warming and cooling effects and are associated with poor air quality, among other things.
\nChat history:\nAnswer: The cause of climate change is the greenhouse effect. Human activity has caused the concentration of greenhouse gases (such as methane or CO2) in the Earth's atmosphere to rise sharply. Due to the greenhouse gas effect, solar heat comes in, but cannot be radiated back into space. This makes the earth warmer and warmer. \n
### Answer the question based on the information in the context.\nQuestion: Who benefits from globalization?\nContext:
In recent decades, both the global production of goods and trade in goods have increased significantly.
Economically developing countries in particular have benefited from the expansion of global trade. Their share of goods exports has almost doubled since the 1970s. However, the main beneficiaries of this development are economically stronger countries such as Mexico, Singapore, South Korea and China.
\nChat history:'What is globalization?','Globalization refers to the process in which worldwide interdependencies increase in areas such as the economy, politics, culture, the environment and communication between individuals, societies, institutions and states'\nAnswer: 
Economically stronger, economically developing countries such as Mexico, Singapore, South Korea and China are the main beneficiaries of globalization. \n
